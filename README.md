# Final-Project
This is a joint work with Malika Wang for our final CS project.

We create a Spider Solitaire card game written in Python. 


To run this game, Processing is required. A simple game tutorial can be found here: 

    https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Solitaire. 
One can access the code by cloning the git repo with the following code: 


     git clone https://github.com/weihang-he/Final-Project.git.
The purpose of the project is to design the classic spider solitaire. 

The game is expected to include to two mode of “easy” and “hard”, which allow the players to choose the number of card suits.  


A hint button, an undo button, a board that records the number of moves, and a record board of the best result are also included.

The game is written in Python and can be run with Processing. We have incorporated the class functions and basic game logic. 

To make the game more personal, we specifically record voices and use as sound effect.


* Note:
Due to naming error, the Final-Project.pyde does not contain the actual code.

Please run the Solitaire.pyde instead.

Below is an image of the acutal game when running:
